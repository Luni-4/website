# WORK IN PROGRESS, MORE COMING SOON

This website is currently a work in progress and will be announced shortly. If
you stumble upon this we'd be grateful if you held off on tweeting or otherwise
sharing it until it's ready.

The current plan is to announce this website 2016-01-10 or very near this date!

# Tokio's Website

The website for the Tokio project. Lives at [https://tokio.rs](https://tokio.rs).

## Getting Started

Building the website depends on [Hugo](http://gohugo.io). So, first make sure
that you have it installed. If on OS X and using Homebrew, run the following:

```sh
brew update && brew install hugo
```

Then, get the website running locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tokio-rs/website.git
cd website
hugo server
```

Then visit [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).
