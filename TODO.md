On the web site:

- `simple-client.md`: Add (or remove) proto client example
  - aturon
- `streaming.md`: Write a simple explanation of how to do pipelines, streaming server protocols. (Add note at the end about combining streaming + multiplexing)
  - carllerche
- `tasks.md`: Write it
  - acrichto
- blog post
  - aturon
- Full edit pass for structure / clarity

In the real docs:

- Make crate-level docs just point to the web site
- Do an audit of API docs
  - futures
  - core
  - service
  - proto (should be in OK shape)
