The Tokio community is most readily found on
[its gitter channel](https://gitter.im/tokio-rs/tokio), where you're welcome to
ask questions, report problems, or pitch ideas.

We also have very active issue trackers on the main Tokio repositories, including:

- [futures-rs](https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-rs/issues)
- [tokio-core](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-core/issues)
- [tokio-service](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-service/issues)
- [tokio-proto](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-proto/issues)

If you're a Tokio user, you're highly encouraged to keep an eye on these issues
and jump in on the discussions, to help us understand how design tradeoffs might
affect you.

These repositories also contain milestones for upcoming *major* releases, which
are currently used to track breaking changes that might be considered for the
next major release.

The Tokio project is currently led by a core team comprised of Carl Lerche, Alex
Crichton, and Aaron Turon.
